				<h1>Sharks</h1>
				<p>Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head,
					and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii)
					and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term "shark" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii
					outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid
					eugenedontidans. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago. Acanthodians
					are often referred to as "spiny sharks"; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper, they are a paraphyletic assemblage
					leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole.</p>
				<p>Since then, sharks have diversified into over 500 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus
					perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest
					fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (39 ft) in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to
					depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such
					as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater. They breathe through
					five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in
					addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth.</p>
				<p>Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex
					predators—organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.</p>

					<h2>Bull Sharks</h2>
					<p>The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua
						shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull
						shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems
						including estuaries and rivers.</p>
					<p>Bull sharks can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater and can travel far up rivers. They have even been known to travel
						as far up the Mississippi River as Illinois, although there have been few recorded freshwater attacks. They are probably
						responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks, including many attacks attributed to other species.</p>
					<p>Unlike the river sharks of the genus Glyphis, bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks, despite their ability to survive
						in freshwater habitats.</p>

					<h2>Great White Sharks</h2>
					<p>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death,
						is a species of large lamniform shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great
						white shark is mainly known for its size, with mature individuals growing up to 6.4 m (21 ft) in length (although reports
						have been published of great white sharks measuring over 8 m (26 ft), and 3,324 kg (7,328 lb) in weight). This shark reaches
						its maturity around 15 years of age and was previously believed to have a life span of over 30 years. The true lifespan of
						great white sharks is far longer; now estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous
						fish currently known. Male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to
						be ready to produce offspring. Great white sharks can accelerate to over 56 km/h (35 mph).</p>
					<p>The great white shark has no natural predators other than the orca. The great white shark is arguably the world's largest
						known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a
						variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon,
						and is ranked first in having the most attacks on humans. The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species, while
						it is included in Appendix II of CITES.</p>
					<p>The bestselling novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent blockbuster film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great
						white shark as a "ferocious man eater". Humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark, but the great white is
						responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.</p>

					<h2>Hammerhead Sharks</h2>
					<p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure
						of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a "cephalofoil". Most hammerhead
						species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily
						mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, maneuvering, and prey manipulation.
						Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads
						usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo
						Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai Island in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in southern
						and eastern Africa.</p>

					<h2>Leopard Sharks</h2>
					<p>The leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) is a species of Houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific
						coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically measuring 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9 ft) long,
						this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots
						over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries,
						swimming over sandy, rocky or muddy flat areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less
						than 4 m (13 ft) deep.</p>

					<h2>Gray Reef Sharks</h2>
					<p>The grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, sometimes misspelled amblyrhynchus or amblyrhinchos) is a species of requiem
						shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. One of the most common reef sharks in the Indo-Pacific, it is found as far east as Easter
						Island and as far west as South Africa. This species is most often seen in shallow water near the drop-offs of coral reefs.
						The grey reef shark has the typical "reef shark" shape, with a broad, round snout and large eyes. This species can be distinguished
						from similar species by the plain or white-tipped first dorsal fin, the dark tips on the other fins, the broad, black rear
						margin on the tail fin, and the lack of a ridge between the dorsal fins. Most individuals are less than 1.9 m (6.2 ft) long.</p>
					<p>Grey reef sharks are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their
						aggressive demeanor enables them to dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey
						reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social
						rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs,
						splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the
						higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the
						grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to
						six pups are born every other year.</p>
					<p>Grey reef sharks were the first shark species known to perform a threat display, a stereotypical behavior warning that it
						is prepared to attack. The display involves a "hunched" posture with characteristically dropped pectoral fins, and an exaggerated,
						side-to-side swimming motion. Grey reef sharks often do so if they are followed or cornered by divers to indicate they perceive
						a threat. This species has been responsible for a number of attacks on humans, so should be treated with caution, especially
						if they begin to display. They are caught in many fisheries and are susceptible to local population depletion due to their
						low reproduction rate and limited dispersal. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed
						this species as Near Threatened.</p>

					<h2>Tiger Sharks</h2>
					<p>The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a species of requiem shark and the only member of the genus Galeocerdo. Commonly
						known as the "Sea Tiger", the tiger shark is a relatively large macropredator, capable of attaining a length over 5 m (16
						ft). It is found in many tropical and temperate waters, and it is especially common around central Pacific islands. Its name
						derives from the dark stripes down its body which resemble a tiger's pattern, which fade as the shark matures.</p>
					<p>The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter, and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks,
						consuming a variety of prey ranging from crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, and sea snakes to dolphins and
						even other smaller sharks. The tiger shark has been known to eat inedible manmade objects that linger in its stomach, and
						it has a reputation as a "garbage eater". The tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing
						by humans.</p>
